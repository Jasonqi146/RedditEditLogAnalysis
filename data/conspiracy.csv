11% of americans don't have one form of IDobtaining government id costs between 75 and 175 USD, due to travel, obtaining birth certificate, and paying fees for the IDthese people are disabled and elderly, and travel is difficult for them.voter id reduces voter turnoutfor example, ""States exclude forms of ID in a discriminatory manner. Texas allows concealed weapons permits for voting, but does not accept student ID cards. Until its voter ID law was struck down, North Carolina prohibited public assistance IDs and state employee ID cards, which are disproportionately held by Black voters. And until recently, Wisconsin permitted active duty military ID cards, but prohibited Veterans Affairs ID cards for voting."" -[https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet](https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet)

""Voter ID laws are enforced in a discriminatory manner. A Caltech/MIT study found that minority voters are more frequently questioned about ID than are white voters.""

""Minority voters disproportionately lack ID. Nationally, up to 25% of African-American citizens of voting age lack government-issued photo ID, compared to only 8% of whites.""

""In-person fraud is vanishingly rare. A recent study found that, since 2000, there were only 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation – the only type of fraud that photo IDs could prevent – during a period of time in which over 1 billion ballots were cast.""

not to mention the cost.  cards aren't free to produce, and it takes work to issue all these free voter id cards you propose. ""Voter ID laws are a waste of taxpayer dollars. States incur sizeable costs when implementing voter ID laws, including the cost of educating the public, training poll workers, and providing IDs to voters.Texas spent nearly $2 million on voter education and outreach efforts following passage of its Voter ID law.11Indiana spent over $10 million to produce free ID cards between 2007 and 2010.""

So, you can argue the illogical drivel of ""minorities are too poor lazy and irresponsible,  to get the thing that their past, their lineage, their uncontrollable circumstances makes harder for them, but then you kinda just turn yourself into a gigantic ignorant dumbfuck at the same time.",/r/conspiracy/comments/11biygw/biden_questioned_about_travelling_to_east/ja6p73i/

Russia literally isn't even using any of its best weapons instead using stockpiles of old munitions they're not even depleting their ars stocks and their nuclear capability is still deadly. 

Only a small portion of the billions sent to Ukraine is actually money. Most is equipment we've already bought and are paying ourselves back for giving. The actual cost isn't even .03% of our gdp.

Russia is using it's best equipment. It's used up a fuckton. T-14s and SU-57s don't exist outside of potemkin parades. Thousands of T-90Ms, T-80BVs, and whatever the modernized T-72 is have been lost of captured. Thousands of BMPs.

They sent a fucking MB-LT into combat at Vuhledar. That's a 50s era soviet apc, slower, less armor and a smaller gun then a BMP. Wtf are they doing using that garbage?

The answer is simple. They don't have enough working BMPs in storage. They have all rusted out in siberia for 30 years while Capt. Corruptokov and Major Klepotvich looted spare parts and electronics for a sweet side hussle.

Do you know why Russia stopped firing 60k artillery shells a day? Because they burnt though the massive soviet stockpile that haven't gone bad(artillery shell have shelf lives) and are operating on subsistence from factory production and being serviced by a terrible logistics train. They fucking hand load shells from trains to trucks, one at a time 😂 

>I don't know what you've been told, But Russia isn't losing this war and the only chance for Ukraine is to sue for peace.

Russia's busted ass, second rate military couldn't beat a nation 1/3 it's size. Russia's only chance not to lose this is to try to convince idiots they are still strong

it was Biden blocked it, Zelensky was willing to negotiate peace he was sure it would be possible.

Now though I don't think Zelensky can negotiate peace hes too far in.

the UN and China can convince Russia to negotiate peace which will include conceding the Donbas as a non negotiating point.

&#x200B;

>Japan also actually has their own territory conflicts with Russia. So theres that for motivation too.

Japan needs to seriously consider not flexing muscles it no longer has. it's a lobotomized mess, nobody takes it seriously. and it overestimates how much America would be willing to help out. if they genuinely try to start border wars with Russia it shows a level of stupidity not seen since Emperor Shōwa, Hirohito's disgrace of japan decided he would invade pearl harbor. play your beat-em ups press your button, jerk off to anime titties shut the fuck up do not get involved.  this is my advice to japan.

I disagree, and I will always be an advocate for peace, and anti-war, always.

This entire comment section is either Russian bots or morons. The USA is not giving ukraine any money at all. The US is giving ukraine weapons that have been sitting in warehouses that were paid for decades ago and within a few years of needing to be decommissioned and needing to be replaced with upgraded models anyway. A lot wont even be replaced because its not even needed anymore. (explosives/fuel have a shelf-life of 20-30 years and pretty much everything going to ukraine is at least 20-25 years old). hell ,even some of the more expensive systems will go back to the countries that donated them when the war is finished. why its called the LEND/LEASE program. A lot will end up getting paid for by ukraine over the next decades with oil/gas/resources/favors, not unlike what england did in ww2.

Every time you see on the news ""US approves new X Billion$ package for ukraine"" thats the value of the weapons when purchased new years ago. Not cash money. NO cash money is going to Ukraine from USA. the EU is giving cash to hold up their economy and buy weapons, USA is just giving old stocks of weapons and the new weapon systems they using ukraine as a testing ground.  There is no money going towards ukraine that could be used for other purposes in USA.

 This is exactly what these weapons were purchased exactly for. degrading russia's military this much for only 100billion is a fucking bargain.a legit war with russia would cost 10s of trillions. Also in a war with china, non of these weapons would be needed. there will be no land war with china so its not degrading USA's ability to fight anywhere else.  

So overall, this is costing the US almost nothing. And the US is gaining a lot while at the same time avoiding an inevitable direct war with russia if they were able to win in ukraine and continue their conquests into places NATO wouldnt be able to ignore and stay out of.",/r/conspiracy/comments/11cyb0c/breaking_zelensky_warns_americans_who_dont_want/ja6cpeu/

This right here is why no one will take you seriously, and just goes to show how uneducated you are.

Obviously, it's not ""my"" data, what I have provided you with countless times is data from several of the almost 200 observational climate datasets that are publicly available, and used daily by scientist and organisations around the world to understand our climate.

Datasets that have been used by 1000s of climate scientist, and people far more knowledgeable, that you and me. My degree is in Aeronautical Engineering, and yours is, oh that's right you don't have one. Anyway, as you can see, I am not a climate scientist, and neither are you.

However, you claim all of this data is just shit, and you, a conspiracy guy from the Internet, has done their own research, and discovered that all of these 1000s of qualified climate scientist and organisations that have studied this data are actually wrong, and you have some secret data and research that shows the planet is NOT warming, which you refuse to share.

This is gutter politics designed to shut down and undermine any opposition or debate.

This gargantuan virtue con-trick also comes with a huge slice of authoritarianism. Anyone who sees through it, questions it, stands up to it or shows opposition to it are immediately ridiculed and ostracised by the group-think ""virtue mob"".

Authoritarianism creates a state controlled, Orwellian ‘big brother’ society. It strips away our freedoms. It snoops on us. History has taught us that authoritarianism never ends well. We forget the lessons of history at our peril.

Of course if you already took the injections I can see why you want to keep living in ignorance, but once you get affected either personally or someone you love then you'll regret being so naive and gullible, or a coward if you took it despite having a bad feeling about it. I really don't think most people who took the injections didn't have a bad gut feeling about taking it, my personal experience is that most who did take it did not feel right about them at first. 🤷‍♂️ But what can you do, once it's done it's done. 

Still I would recommend against taking boosters to people I care about and against keeping trusting the government personally. US and western governments in general have such a long track record of lying and spying on its people, all the fake wars started on admittedly fake reasons etc that nobody should trust them. Operation Northwood, Tuskegee, injecting people with radiation are just a few verifiable examples. The Vietnam war which killed 60 000 US servicemen and wounded and scarred hundreds of thousands Americans. Conspiring with the Israelis to make false flag with the USS Liberty Incident to try and drag America into war with Egypt. The Iraq War started on a fake WMD hoax.

Question the Covid response? 
**“Covidiot”**

Question the war?
**“Putin apologist”**

Question net zero?
**“Climate change denier”**

Question 15 minute cities?
**“Far-right conspiracy theorist”**

This is gutter politics designed to shut down and undermine any opposition or debate.

This gargantuan virtue con-trick also comes with a huge slice of authoritarianism. Anyone who sees through it, questions it, stands up to it or shows opposition to it are immediately ridiculed and ostracised by the group-think ""virtue mob"".

If you can't see that it's a giant asset grab of what we own and control or that they're trying to ring-fence society into being controlled by a digital ID, then you're part of the problem. They frame all of this being in our best interests but it’s the biggest swindle ever.

Authoritarianism creates a state controlled, Orwellian ‘big brother’ society. It strips away our freedoms. It snoops on us. History has taught us that authoritarianism never ends well. We forget the lessons of history at our peril.

15 minute cities where the only food to eat will be synthetic tumour meat grown from human cancer cells if you're wealthy enough, if not, you'll be eating insects grown in gigantic vats or Bill Gates' roundup burgers.  

It's basically snowpiercer the movie but for cities instead of trains. Read up on the dust bowl migrants. Read up on who bought their land. These 15 minute ghettos are open air prisons designed to kettle humanity into restricted zones for extermination.",/r/conspiracy/comments/11cy91j/cleveland_ohio_is_set_to_become_the_first_15/ja5xb2g/

Now its a battle for survival for the Ukrainians who won’t stop fighting, and the Russian military keeps bleeding and getting weaker by the day. If Russia were winning, they wouldn’t need to be making nuclear threats.

You can't say a future event that's extremely likely to occur and is the most obvious ending to anyone actually following this is a lie when we don't know how it will end. 

Then just repeat random talking points all people who think Ukraine will win use that's just being pumped out by western media that has censored anything coming out of Russia to challenge this and be so ignorant and unaware of what that means that you think anyone suggesting the bigger country will win is lying about something that hasn't occurred yet... and just a reminder you can't lie about an ending scenario being a lie that hasn't ended yet...and that side is the one falling for propaganda... 


>
>Not sure why you think the US military isn’t involved, America has been supplying arms and training to the Ukrainians. 

Because again, this is common sense to everyone so not sure how you're just not getting it. Everyone understands the US Military is sending weapons and aid. But no country is sending people. 

Russia is about 4x the population of Ukraine and that was before about half the Ukraine population fled. 

Ukraine will eventually start to run out of abled body fighters. 

You can send all the aid, money and weapons you want, but when you start running out of fighters to use it that's going to be obvious to every country sending aid and once that becomes obvious all countries will stop sending weapons and aid for a losing battle. 

So, again, and I don't know how this has to be explained to you, but unless other countries eventually start sending troops and not just supplies Ukraine will never win. Russia has more bodies and can outlast them. 

>
>Having someone else weaken your rival without suffering casualties is the kind of geopolitical gift America is going to take every chance it gets. Russia is screwed. 

They literally aren't screwed at all on the only reason you would think this is because of propaganda. 

Countries and companies still sell everything to Russia. 

I have multiple customers in Moscow. 
They just opened LLCs in Kazakhstan and bank accounts and everything is shipped and paid for by shell companies opened neighboring countries then shipped to Russia. 

Anything they can't get that way they get from China. 

Nothing has changed except some American companies ceased operations to gain social media points but didn't actually cease operations and just rebranded their stuff in Russia and a lot of things cost more but that's true everywhere the last year. 


They also made billions more selling energy to other countries because the sanctions caused energy prices to soar. 

But hey, man. You keep thinking they are screwed and getting their ass kicked and are about to descend into the dark ages due to lack of trading partners because some idiots repeating MSM talking points say so.

The Department of Energy is my source. You know, the agency that did the study you keep avoiding linking to.... So your source is my source. 

Unless you don't trust your source now that they proved you wrong. 


https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/26/politics/covid-lab-leak-wuhan-china-intelligence/index.html

I see you're still just not linking to the entire report like a normal person would do especially after being called out... but this will do. You really can't get pedantic when dealing with idiots so let's continue.... 

You apparently just can't understand that at the end of the day..... 3yrs after this started nobody has any real actual idea or proof where it came from or they are lying but even if it did leak on accident it might still be impossible to prove.

Nobody is saying it definitely came from the lab. 

Nobody apparently has any proof one way or the other where it did or didn't come from and while it's low confidence it accidentally leaking from a research lab that deals with these that's also in the same city  as the first detected cases is the most likely source but nobody actually knows and may never know but it's regarded now by agencies around the world as the most likely cause. 

Low confidence means we have zero proof of anything but using common sense and minimal data if we had to make an educated guess it would be an accidental lab leak. 


The reason people are outraged and I'm still not understanding how you don't get this is because suggesting the Wuhan Lab might be the source early on was immediately rejected and got you labeled as a conspiracy theorist and was somehow debunked by social media, fact checkers, and politicians on the left as misinformation almost immediately. 

Are you insane or just trolling? Or just this detached from reality? Serious question. 

Early on they said it came from bat soup at a market but they also claimed to not know when the first case was or who patient zero was.

Everyone's bullshit detector should have been going off immediately.

If you don't know exactly when and where it started then you can't determine the source.

People were saying it probably came from the bio safety level 4 lab in Wuhan ... Whether a natural version or one being studied or modified via gain of function. Most associate being ""made in a lab"" to mean it was developed as a weapon. This was a fringe theory.

Immediately the lab origin was said to be a wild conspiracy theory and impossible and misinformation and was removed from a lot of social media. Literally one of the few labs in the world studying these things was in the same city as the first outbreak but somehow even suggesting it came from there was a conspiracy theory. Fact checkers debunked the claim with literally no investigation almost immediately. 

Again, people's bullshit detectors should have been going off.

If you don't know when it started, who patient zero was, or the source of the original infection was, you can't eliminate plausible options like a lab researching these things but people didn't question it.

Now we know it's because the US Federal government was funding the lab and doing GOF research there and we were more than likely involved in the development of it and accidental release. 

So much obvious bullshit like this occured that people never questioned that was so obvious to everyone at the time the stories they were telling weren't adding up.

""We have no clue when or where Covid started but we assure that even though we don't know the source we can tell you it wasn't the BSL4 research lab in town that messes around with these things that we disguise our financial involvement with and there has been no investigation into the source but we promise it's not the BSL4 lab in Wuhan and you're just going to have to trust us.""

No sane person being told that scenario before Covid would ever believe that using common sense and critical thinking.

Now, turns out most experts agree that the accidental leak from the Wuhan Lab is the most likely scenario but they really have no proof of it or any other theory.",/r/conspiracy/comments/11cnqqs/no_longer_a_conspiracy_theory/ja5fmfm/

It didn’t have to happen on large scales. Just a few counties like Fulton, maricopa, Philly, Milwaukee. Never said it was nationwide. It’s very obvious to see if you do not ignore reality.

Again, you’ve failed to answer questions as to how a new mail in ballot system was secure. This was largely agreed upon prior to TDS.

“that voter fraud involving mail-in ballots “is vastly more prevalent than the in-person voting fraud that has attracted far more attention, election administrators say.“

""Fungus broke our genetic code as humans approximately 15,000 years ago. We've traced it to a specific geolocation and point in time. The fungus affected our IL-17 and IL-22 cytokine pathways, CARD9 and STAT1 gene, allowing chronic systemic infection while we are still in the womb. It takes early control of our bodily systems and uses us as a food source. It is intelligent and can work in colonies or as one super organism. It is responsible for nearly every disease known, and allopathic (western) doctors are specifically trained to look everywhere but the root of the problem. It causes brain disorders, tooth decay, heart problems, organ problems, degrades your eyesight, slows down your brain process, is a primary cause of cancer, anxiety, depression, gout, skin disorders, myalgias, sclerosis, damages your DNA and is one of the primary hidden factors of aging itself.""",/r/conspiracy/comments/118mzx5/cancer_is_a_trillion_dollar_industry_highdose/j9idjvp/

They weren't going there to make sure everything was done to the standards of the public. They were going there to make sure everything was up to *the company's* standards.


Here's what some residents are saying the company did for them in East Palestine where CTEH was also the original environmental team hired by Norfolk Southern:

>We were told by Norfolk personnel that the agency coming to our homes to test was from independent laboratories. Now, what I can tell you first hand is that we had a gentleman from CTEH, which is the so-called independent laboratory, we had spoken to him very informally, and he said, “we follow around the railroad when they make mistakes, and they are happy to have us here.”

>When CTEH came to our facility to test our air, they had not offered water services at that point in time; they handed me a contract that essentially said that I needed to hold Norfolk, their affiliates, including CTEH, harmless of any future liabilities.

>I didn’t sign it, but unfortunately, 340 other residents did sign it. That’s where my heart just breaks for these people because we don’t know the long-term repercussions of what these chemicals can do in our air to our environment to our businesses and they’ve signed their rights away in the hopes that they are getting help and the right answers from these organizations.



Remember those stories about people being persuaded to sign agreements not to sue in exchange for testing?
